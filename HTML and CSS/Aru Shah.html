    <h1>Meet Aru Shah</h1>

    <div class="character-section">
        <!-- Character Image -->
        <img src="c:\Users\user\Downloads\arundhati.png" alt="Aru Shah" class="character-img">

        <!-- Description Section -->
        <div class="content-box description">
            <h2>Who is Aru Shah?</h2>
            <!-- Prompt: Describe Aru's character and her unique qualities as a hero. Include her backstory and how she stumbled upon her powers. -->
            <p>Aru Shah is not your average middle-schooler. With a sharp wit and a curious mind, she sometimes finds herself in trouble—usually of her own making. Raised by a single mother who curates an ancient museum, Aru is no stranger to stories of myths and legends, though she never thought they’d have anything to do with her. That all changes the day she lights a supposedly cursed lamp in an attempt to impress her classmates, accidentally awakening an ancient evil known as The Sleeper.

                Realizing she is a reincarnation of the great Pandava warrior Arjuna, Aru suddenly finds herself bearing the weight of heroic duties and unexpected powers. Thrust into a magical world of gods, monsters, and ancient prophecies, Aru’s journey is not just about defeating mystical foes but also discovering the bravery and strength within herself. Despite the dangers, her unique blend of humor, resourcefulness, and loyalty sets her apart as a hero unlike any other. She’s learning that being a hero isn’t about being perfect—it’s about rising to the challenge, flaws and all.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Personality Traits Section -->
        <div class="content-box traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <!-- Prompt: Highlight Aru’s core personality traits, showing her as both human and a hero.-->
             <p> At her core, Aru Shah is a captivating mix of bravery, humor, and vulnerability. Unlike the flawless heroes of legend, Aru’s courage is tinged with uncertainty and her bold actions often hide a softer, more self-conscious side. She’s witty and unafraid to use humor as both a shield and a weapon, finding levity even in dangerous situations, which brings her—and those around her—a sense of comfort in the face of fear.

                Her bravery shines through in her willingness to confront terrifying forces, even when she’s unsure if she can truly win. Aru’s quirks make her endearing: she’s got a soft spot for chocolate, an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and a habit of giving herself pep talks before charging into battle. As much as she’s a hero, Aru’s still a kid with flaws, doubts, and dreams, balancing her responsibilities to the world with her desire to be understood and valued just as she is. Her imperfections only serve to make her a more relatable and inspiring figure—a hero who’s both human and extraordinary.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Powers Section -->
        <div class="content-box powers">
            <h2>Powers & Abilities</h2>
            <!-- Prompt: Describe Aru’s powers, abilities, and any mystical weapons or skills she possesses as a descendant of the Pandavas. -->
            <p>Aru doesn't possess any powers of any sort but she does have a lightning bolt named Vajra who can shapeshift into anything making it really easy to win wars and make super cool enterances (But we know how her enterances usually look like...)</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Embarrassing Facts Section -->
        <div class="content-box embarrassing-facts">
            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <!-- Prompt: Share some lighthearted or embarrassing stories that show Aru’s fun side, adding personality to her heroic image. -->
            <p>One memorable day, Aru was invited to attend an official event in the Otherworld—something about honoring young heroes and all their brave acts. Determined to look the part, Aru picked out her finest outfit, even practicing her "serious hero face" in the mirror to add to the mystique. But in her hurry to get ready (and after a minor chocolate-related distraction), she didn't notice she’d put on one green shoe and one blue.

                Marching into the grand hall, Aru attempted a confident stride, thinking she must look like some divine force to be reckoned with. She only realized the mismatch when a snickering demigod pointed it out mid-ceremony, and the entire hall turned to look. Blushing like a ripe tomato, Aru managed a sheepish grin and tried to play it cool, throwing a quick, “It’s a new fashion statement, obviously.” From then on, her friends teased her as the “Mismatched Hero”—a title Aru pretended to dislike but secretly found pretty hilarious.</p>
