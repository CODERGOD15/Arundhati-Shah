  <h1>About My Design Problem</h1>
  <p>
In today's digital age, misinformation has become one of the most prevalent challenges, particularly on the internet. The vast number of websites and online platforms often spread misleading or inaccurate information, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. This issue is especially significant for students like myself, who depend on the internet as a primary source for research and learning.
    
    I chose to address this problem because I have noticed the impact of misinformation firsthand, especially in relation to a book series I am passionate about. Unfortunately, there are numerous rumors and false claims circulating online, creating confusion for readers. As someone who values accurate information, I felt compelled to create a solution.
    
    To tackle this, I have designed a website as part of my project. This platform will serve as a reliable source, providing accurate and clear information to help dispel the myths and confusion surrounding the series. Through this project, I aim to contribute to a more informed and educated online community.
